A real-time object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture. This project utilizes deep learning to detect and classify objects in images or video streams with high accuracy and speed.

Technologies Used
YOLO (v3/v4/v5/v8 depending on your choice)
OpenCV â€“ For video capture and visualization
PyTorch or Ultralytics YOLO (for v5/v8)
